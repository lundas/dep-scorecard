## About
Vulnerabilities in open-source projects provide serious security risks for all software development projects. A number of tools exist to help engineers evaluate the security of their open-source dependencies. Dependency Scorecard is a tool that aggregates information from public APIs to help developers make informed decisions regarding the security of their project dependencies.

## Usage
*Currently Supported Files: package.json*
Drag and drop (or click to select) a file into the specified area. Dependency Scorecard then generates a scorecard using information from public deps.dev APIs.
